Installation (Linux Version):

0. Install SSpro4.0 package first. Get it from: http://contact.ics.uci.edu/download.html. Very easy to install. 

1.unzip dispro1.0.tar.gz
	e.g. tar xzf  dispro1.0.tar.gz

2.change directory into dispro1.0 
	e.g. cd dispro1.0

3. edit configure.pl
	set dispro path ($install_dir) and SSpro4 path ($pspro_dir) to their installation directories.

4. run configure.pl
	e.g. ./configure.pl

Installation is done.

Check the integrity of installation
	cd test
	../bin/predict_diso.sh seq.fasta test.out

	The result in test.out should be the same as that in seq.diso.
	Output format:
		line 1: sequence
		line 2: D -> disorer, O -> order
		line 3: probability of disorder. You can set different
			thresholds to make your own disorder/order predictions.
			line 2 are generated by setting threshold to 0.5. 

Scripts in bin subdirectory:

	predict_diso.sh: predict disordered residues 


Enjoy it!
