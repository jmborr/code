If you regularly install the latest version of the fasta3 package from
ftp://ftp.virginia.edu/pub/fasta, you may want to join the fasta_list
majordomo mailing list.  I plan to use this list to announce new
releases and solicit bug reports.

To join the mailing list, send the following email message to:
majordomo@virginia.edu

	subscribe fasta_list
	end
