These are example database files for SCANPS.
sprot.fas is the original FASTA formatted sequence file as downloaded from 
the EBI.

sprot.bix and sprot.bsq are the binary database and index files
generated by SCANPS.

After downloading and unpacking the scanps distribution, copy the three files 
above into the subdirectory of scanps called "db".

See scanps_manual for details of how to use these files.
