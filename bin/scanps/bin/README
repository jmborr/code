Binaries for SCANPS compiled with different options.
Those starting with xp include explicit assembly code for MMX and where
possible SSE instructions.

xpscanps_16K	Compiled for Pentium III architecture.  This should also work
                OK on other architectures such as the Athlon.  I have only
                tested it on PIII and AthlonXP.

xpscanps_16K_P4 Compiled for Pentium IV (I have not tested this binary as
                I do not have  PIV machine running Linux - if you do try it
                please give me some performance figures for comparing
                hahu.fa to the supplied sprot database (ie the output file)).


If you have problems with any of the above binaries on the architecture for
which they have been compiled, let me know (geoff@compbio.dundee.ac.uk).  If
you don't have one of the supported architectures, then try the binaries below.
They lack MMX/SSE support.

uscanps_16K and scanps_16K_p4  are similarly compiled,
but lack the MMX and SSE support.
