  unfilter.pl

Obtain proteins with less than 100 amino acids from the list of homology
files in /net/dell/01/users/skolnick/pdbhomoljul05, and output them to
'unfiltered.list'

  filter.pl

Read unfiltered.list, which is the set of proteins with less than 100 amino
acids in pdbJul05. Then selects a subset such that no pair of proteins in
this subset are homologous. Protein A is homologous to protein B is B shows
up in file A.homol, located in
'/net/dell/01/users/skolnick/pdbhomoljul05'. After the process we obtain
'filtered.list'

  cas_rd.f

Tasser1.0 with initial random conformation, not template.
