#report of templates with highest Z-scores. Each of the templates has
#the highest Z-score for one of the g8 sequences. We write the
#corresponding functions for a few of them.
#
#We start by first stating the function of the co-ocurring domains,
#according to He06, then stating the putative function of G8

Co-ocurring domains to G8 and their functions (according to 
IPT/TIG	control of cell dissociation and motility
GG	predicted to be structurally important in long fibers
PbH1	polysaccharide hydrolysis
	=> G8 may be involved in  extracellular ligand binding and catalysis processing
