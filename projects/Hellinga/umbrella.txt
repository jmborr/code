Variables:
native coordinates (double precision 2D-array)
previous rmsd of each replica (double 1D-array),rmsdprev_rev
rmsd targets for each replica (double 1D-array),rmsdtarget_rev
rmsd after move (double), rmsdnew
minimum rmsd (double), rmsdmin
maximum rmsd (double), rmsdmax

Subroutines:
(1)read native file. Input is file file name. Output are native coordinates
(3)populate rmsdtarget_rev=(rmsdmax/rmsdmin)^( (rev-1)/(nrepf-1) ) * rmsdmin. This ensure that rmsdtarget_1=rmsdmin, and rmsdtarget_nrepf=rmsdmax, and rmsdtarget_nrep>rmsdmax
(2)accept/reject move if:
	rmsd < rmsdtarget_rev, or
	rmsdtarget_rev < rmsd < rmsdprev_rev
	rmsd < rmsdtarget_{rev+1} and 
           randon_number > (rmsd - rmsdtarget_rev)/(rmsdtarget_{rev+1} - rsmdtarget_rev)

Fortran reference
Including Fortran Source Files: INCLUDE "filename"
INCLUDE files are especially recommended when the same COMMON blocks and the same
COMMON block data mappings are used in several program units. For example the following
statement includes the file MYFILE.DEF.
INCLUDE "MYFILE.DEF"
