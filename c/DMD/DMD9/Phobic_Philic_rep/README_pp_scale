By using the Kyte & Doolite hydrophobicity scale, we modify files 
pseudoTXT.h (to pseudoTXT_hp_scale.h )and txtGene.cpp (to
 txtGene_hp_scale.cpp).

Most important: introduction of the scale in pseudoTXT_hp_scale.h via the 
array "const static double dmd_atom_hp_scale[]"

Also the hydrophobic--hydrophobic atraction and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic
repulsion are given by formula
                 
                     U_{ij} = - h_i * h_j

For hydrophobic (hydrophilic) residues, h_i is negative (positive).
