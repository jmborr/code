5-bead model of Feng

Write the following files to /tmp/, then write from time to time these files to the "working directory"

  echo (data)
  rms
  contact
  movie
  phipsi
  corr_func
  txt (configuration)

The code saves all these files to the "working directory" every time it
saves a new configuration (.txt file).

In addition, We  modify files
 search.c
 search.h
 bcp.c
for the following reasons:

We modify function "squeeze1" in file search.c and add function set_search_volume().

We modify function "void set_new_bounds(double *L, double maxrb,int ndim)" in bcp.c by calling "set_search_volume(maxrb);"

The point of this modification is to only compute collisions for atoms that are closer than a distance "maxrb * 1.20" to the atom we're interested in.

NOTE: to calculate the distance of an atom to the "central" atom, we do not synchronize their local time. This way we incurr in some error but computations are faster.

We obtain a speed up of 33%, but the trade-off is some missed collisions!
