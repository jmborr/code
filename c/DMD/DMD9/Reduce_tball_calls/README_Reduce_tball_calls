We only modify files:
 search.c
 search.h
 bcp.c


We modify function "squeeze1" in file search.c and add function set_search_volume().

We modify function "void set_new_bounds(double *L, double maxrb,int ndim)" in bcp.c by calling "set_search_volume(maxrb);"

The point of this modification is to only compute collisions for atoms that are closer than a distance "maxrb * 1.20" to the atom we're interested in.

NOTE: to calculate the distance of an atom to the "central" atom, we do not synchronize their local time. This way we incurr in some error but computations are faster.

We obtain a speed up of 33%, but the trade-off is some missed collisions!
