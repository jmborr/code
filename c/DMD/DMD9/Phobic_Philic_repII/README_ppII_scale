By using the Kyte & Doolite hydrophobicity scale, we modify files 
pseudoTXT.h (to pseudoTXT_hp_scale.h )and txtGene.cpp (to
 txtGene_hp_scale.cpp).

Most important: introduction of the scale in pseudoTXT_hp_scale.h via the 
array "const static double dmd_atom_hp_scale[]"

Also the hydrophobic--hydrophobic atractions are given by formula              
                     U_{ij} =  (h_i + h_j)/2  ----h_i and h_j are negative---
and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic repulsions by 
                     U_{ij} =  |h_i - h_j|/2  ----h_i negative, h_j positive---
