bcp.h:	add the field "mij" in the CollisioinData
	which is the sum of mi and mj;

make_system.c: define a cutoff of mass to define static atoms:1E8
	if the atom's mass is bigger than this value, the type of atom
	is assumed as static and the velocity is always assumed as 0.
	if the collision evolves this kind of static atom:
	dm = 0;
	edm= 2*e*d^2/m; m is mass of the moving atom
	mij = DBL1;

bcp.c:	ab is orignial propotional to dm; now propotional to 1/dd
	then the velocity change is devided by mij. The corresponding
	changed is applied when one of the atom is of the static type.
	the change is in function newvel and reaction.

movie.c: using the old movie.c format.
