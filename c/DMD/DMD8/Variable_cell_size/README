lists of collision types:

when to update the lists:

          crossing    crossing      collision
  hot                    X             X

  wall                   X             X

list of first times types:
  hot (for the hot list)
  warm (for the warm list)
  wall (for the wall collision)
  first (the champion of the previous times)

search for champion collision with a tree scheme. tree is by atoms,
not by cells.
