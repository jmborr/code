/*Rules : 

1. Every cell has a list of atoms (clist). 
Every atom is represented in the collision list of a cell . 
it also has a pointer the soonest collision in this cell.
alist * cell_champion.

2. Each atom has a collision list (alist) which has 8 elements: 
first atom p, next atom q>p, collision type c, time t, nextp, nextq,
prevp, prevq. nextp points to the next element involved with p;
the same for q and the nextq points to the next element involved with q. 
Each atom list starts with the wall collision (q>=n_atom). Scanning
of the list for say atom m is going in the following way :
if m==p we use nextp or prev p, otherwise we use nextq or prevq 

3. If the collision is of internal type, it is always listed in the
collision list.

4. If the collision is of external type it is listed if and only if
its time is smaller than both of the times of leaving the cell for each
atom.

6. matrix of collisions shows the types of external colisions for atom
pairs which are not represented in collision table. External collisions
can be of finite energy. Historically, for private use, if their energy 
is positive , it means attraction (gain of kinetic energy) For public
use we use conventional negative potential energies for attraction.
The numbers of external collisions are numbered from 0 to nen1.
From 0 to nen-1 - collisions with finite energies;
from nen to nen0-1 collisions with infinite energy: ellastic repulsions)
from nen0 to nen1-1 collisions of bonded pairs. 
It is a triangular array of int ** excoll

7. If the collision is of the wall type (q>=n_atom), 
then find_atoms from new_loc 
is called. This function is removing atom from one cell and adding
it to another. From thiis function find_collisions is called
in which we go 
through the collision list of the atom, and do not clean up the 
lists of the neighboring atoms which must be in
the intersection of the neighboring cells of the old and the new
cell, constructing the array collp[], which originally filled with -1,
indicating that an atom is not present in the cell, and fill this
array with -2 which means that the atoms will collide as before.
Then in function find_atoms we go though the cell list of 27 
neighboring cells of the new cell and add  collp[] if it is equal to -1.  
Such element of collp collq is filled with excoll[][] of atoms type.

8. In squeeze1, in function kill_collisions 
we scan the collision lists of atom lists of p and q
and completly clean them up cleaning also the records in the lists of 
the atoms involved in these collisions and construct an arrays 
collp[] and collq[] which
originally filled with -1 indicating that an atom is not present in
the cells. While scanning we delete the collisions in which given
atoms (p or q) take part and put the values of collisions in the collp
or collq memorizing the values of atoms into arrays atomp and atomq
and amounts nq and np of colliding atoms. After this in function 
add_extern_atom we go through
the cell lists of 27 neighboring cells and add those atoms
into collp and collq if the corresponding element in collp and collq is -1,
and such element of collp collq is filled with excoll[][] of atoms
type. These values are ovewritten by a type of particle collision if
it is found later.

 * The structure for effective search of minimal collision   
 * each cell has its  cellist which is the cell list
 * of atoms (clist). Each atom has two lists of collisions (alist).
 * atom_collisionp and atom_cllisionq; In the atom_collisionp
 * the collisions in which the second partner has number larger
 * than this atom. This list is sorted. Other list atom_cllisionq
 * has collisions in which the second partner has smaller number
 * than this atom. This list will be kept unsorted.
 * The nodes of alist are kept in "storage". To indicate which of 
 * nodes are free index array "begin" and a current free address  
 * "free" is used. In update_table, we make bubble sort for each
 * atom involved in atomq and atomp. If the topmost record, corresponding
 * to the next collision of this atom is changed we determine
 * if this atom is the smallest partner construct the array of
 * atoms changed_atom, analgous to atomp, which will keep the the atom numbers
 * which soonest collision has been changed. Next we go through this
 * list and find cells wich contain atom with p-participant of these 
 * collisions. Each cell has a pointer to the soonest collision
 * record cell_champion.
 * We define the affected cells in function
 * cell_change. 
 * The champions of each cell is determined by the soonest collision
 * in the collision list of cell_atom[i] in function local_champion
 * (i<maxadd,    
 * the number of cells in the system) form an olympic table "olymp"
