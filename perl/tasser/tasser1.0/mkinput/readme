1. Generate secondary structure prediction (run mkseq.pl)
   input file:
	seq.txt   !fasta file
   output file:
	seq.dat   !SS prediction

2. Generate *.dat (run mkdat.pl)
   Before run 'mkdat.pl', please make sure $bin_dir and $data_dir in
   correct directories.
   The default sequence identity cutoff is 0.3. For real runs (like CASP
   or genome), please change 0.3 in Line 282 to a value >1. This value is 
   the sequence identity cutoff for TASSER files.

   input files:
	seq.txt   !fasta file
	seq.dat   !SS prediction
	template.dat !PROSPECTOR_3 template
	contact.dat  !contact file by PROSPECTOR_3
	(To run the programs correctly, pls notice the format of 
	 'template.dat' and 'contact.dat', which are slightly different
	 from originally PROSPECTOR_3 output)
   output files:
	chain.dat
	comb.dat
	combCA.dat
	dist.dat
	distL.dat
	exp.dat
	par.dat

3. generate pair.* (run mkpair.pl)
   Before run 'mkdat.pl', please make sure $bin_dir and $data_dir in
   correct directories.
   please change $run into "benchmark" (seqID<30%) or "real" accordingly.

   input files:
	seq.txt   !fasta file
	seq.dat   !SS prediction
   output files:
	pair.3
	pair.1
