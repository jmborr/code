=head1 NAME

Text::Shellwords

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Shellwords;
  @words = shellwords($line);
  @words = shellwords(@lines);
  @words = shellwords();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This used to be a wrapper around shellwords.pl, but has now been
superseded by Text::ParseWords.  Use that module insteade.  If you
use this module, it will simply report the shellwords() function from
Text::ParseWords.

The old description follows:

This is a thin wrapper around the shellwords.pl package, which comes
preinstalled with Perl.  This module imports a single subroutine,
shellwords().  The shellwords() routine parses lines of text and
returns a set of tokens using the same rules that the Unix shell does
for its command-line arguments.  Tokens are separated by whitespace,
and can be delimited by single or double quotes.  The module also
respects backslash escapes.

If called with one or more arguments, shellwords() will treat each
argument as a line of text, parse it, and return the tokens.  If
called without any arguments, shellwords() will parse B<$_> and
clobber it.
