	* GaussHelmert.pm: version 0.041 wasn't recognized by cpan, so I
	try it with 0.05

	* t/line_estimation.t: set the random seed so that tests are
	reproducible (this was unfortunately commented)

	* GaussHelmert.pm: version 0.04 is the release version, no
	further changes applied

	* GaussHelmert.pm: verbose() can now take a filename as argument
	for the logfile.

	* example/line2d-estimation.pl: added some comments

	* GaussHelmert.pm: remove "number of contradictions/constraints"
	as parameters.  I can get this from the size of the vectors in $y
	and $b. Tested succesfully with Math::UncertainGeometry.
