to compile, just:

g++ -o stretched_chain.x stretched_chain.cpp pdbClasses2.cpp

g++ -o pdb2txt_relax.x pdb2txt_relax.cpp amino_acid_param.cpp atom_param.cpp bibliography.cpp miscellanea.cpp pdbClasses2.cpp

and

g++ -o txt2txt.x txt2txt.cpp amino_acid_param.cpp atom_param.cpp bibliography.cpp miscellanea.cpp pdbClasses2.cpp


I have only implemented to generate a chain from a sequence file, not from a
PDB file.  Thus if you have file "seq" with the amino acid sequence, you do:

./stretched_chain.x seq pre-relaxed.pdb

The output file pre-relaxed.pdb is a stretched chain of amino acids ( I have
 a bug that does not allow to generate chain in othe Phi-Psi angle
 conformations). You will see that pre-relaxed.pdb has some steric clashes
 that will have to be relaxed with the DMD that implements the hydrogen
 bonds. For this, you do

./pdb2txt_relax.x pre-relaxed.pdb box_size atom_param.dat pre-relaxed.txt

box_size is one of the sides of the cube that will contain the peptide.
atom_param.dat is the "force field" file, that list constrains and interactions
pre-relaxed.txt is the output file, suitable to run DMD

Now you run DMD with pre-relaxed.txt for some time (like 1000 time steps) a
low temperature (like 0.1), and a high thermal coefficient (like 0.15). Save the last conformation as relaxed.txt

Now you put the physical interactions plus hydrogen bonds like this

./txt2txt.x relaxed.txt pre-relaxed.pdb atom_param.dat init.txt

The output file is init.txt, to be run with DMD.


I have not implemented many of the features that you had, specially
manipulation of Phy-Psi angles.
