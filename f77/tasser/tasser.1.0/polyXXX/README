cas.f:
  * Simulations for poly-ala only. Some energy terms are modified             *
  * hydrogen bond energy for beta is stronger if long range                   *
  * hydrogen bonds only between alpha-alpha and beta-beta                     *
  * new hydrogen bond list prevents a residue making more than two bonds      *
  * quarsi3 potential modified such that two amino acids have no interactions *
  * if both are in coils, 1/4 if one is in coil and not the other             *
in.dd:
  contains semi-optimized parameters

second_int/:
  cas.f:
    As cas.f in parent directory, but we add:
    * new energy term for second neighbors in the beta-type HB                  *
  in.dd:
    contains semi-optimized parameters
