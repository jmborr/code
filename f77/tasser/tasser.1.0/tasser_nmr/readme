contact strength depends on sequence separation as follows:
   E = Emin * ( 1 + ( SE - SEmin)/( SEmax - SEmin) )
   where SE is sequence separation (or contact order CO) between CA's
   where SEmin is the sequence separation of the restraint with the minimum SE
   where SEmax is the sequence separation of the restraint with the maximum SE

contact strength increase in time to double their original values
