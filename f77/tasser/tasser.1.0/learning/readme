In principle, all the adjustable parameters are inside in.dd.
To obtain the best performance, one need to run the program 'cas'
several times. Every time the some parameters in 'in.dd' should 
be changed. Let's define two kinds of runs: 'A' and 'B'.
For each protein, one need to run 'A' 3~5 times, 'B' 10~20 times.

Please change parameters in 'in.dd' as following:

%ncycle=(
	 'A'=>1000,
	 'B'=>350,
	 );

%switch=(
	 'A'=>1,
	 'B'=>2,
	 );

for(i=1;i<=20;i++){
  ithr0=i
  random=1111+i*13  (a new integer as random number seed)
}

After all runs finished, run spicker for clustering. Please 
remember to use different name for the output trajectories.

To compile TASSER program, use
pgf77 -Mextend -O -s -fast -Wl,-static -o cas cas.f
