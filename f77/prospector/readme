compilation instructions

(1)Open a terminal, then issue statement to change to 32bit
   'module switch apps/PGI64/6.1 apps/PGI32/6.1'
(3)compile statically each file (option Bstatic)
   'pgf77 -Mextend -Bstatic file.f -o file'
   Because we compiled with static libraries, the executables
   will not call 64bit libraries.
